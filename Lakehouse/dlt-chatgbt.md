# Solutions from Chatgbt to implement Lakehouse platform to work on ETL workflows and dashboards reporting.

Here's an overview of the steps you can follow to set up a lakehouse platform using Azure Databricks for batch ETL and dashboard reporting:

- Create an Azure Databricks workspace: To start, you'll need to create an Azure Databricks workspace. You can do this by logging into the Azure portal and selecting "Create a resource", then searching for "Azure Databricks" and following the steps to create a workspace.

- Set up your lakehouse: Next, you'll need to set up your lakehouse in Azure. This involves creating an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account to store your data lake, as well as configuring access controls and setting up data ingestion pipelines using Azure Data Factory or Azure Event Hubs.

- Configure your Azure Databricks cluster: Once you have your lakehouse set up, you'll need to configure your Azure Databricks cluster to process and analyze the data. This involves selecting the appropriate cluster size and configuration options, as well as installing any necessary libraries or packages.

- Create your ETL pipelines: With your cluster set up, you can begin creating your ETL pipelines to transform and load your data into your lakehouse. You can use a variety of tools and techniques for this, such as Apache Spark or SQL-based transformations.

- Build your dashboards: Once your data is loaded into your lakehouse, you can begin building dashboards and reports to visualize and analyze the data. You can use a variety of tools for this, such as Azure Synapse Analytics or Power BI.

- Monitor and maintain your platform: Finally, it's important to monitor and maintain your lakehouse platform to ensure it remains secure, reliable, and performant. This involves setting up alerts and monitoring tools, performing regular maintenance and updates, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and best practices.

I hope this overview helps get you started with building your lakehouse platform on Azure Databricks! Let me know if you have any additional questions or need more guidance on any of these steps.

## Implementing a multi-hop architecture with Delta Lake and Delta Live Tables in Azure Databricks for incremental auto load and analysis. Here are the steps you can follow:

- Set up your Delta Lake: Create a Delta Lake using your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. This will serve as your centralized data repository where you can store and manage your data.

- Define your bronze, silver, and gold layers: Define three layers for your data: bronze, silver, and gold. The bronze layer is the raw, unprocessed data; the silver layer is the cleaned, transformed data; and the gold layer is the final, processed data ready for analysis.

- Load data into the bronze layer: Use Azure Data Factory or Azure Event Hubs to ingest data into the bronze layer. This data should be in its raw, unprocessed form.

- Transform data into the silver layer: Use Delta Lake and Azure Databricks to transform the data in the bronze layer into the silver layer. This includes cleaning, filtering, and aggregating the data as needed.

- Transform data into the gold layer: Use Delta Lake and Azure Databricks to further transform the data in the silver layer into the gold layer. This includes additional processing and analysis, as well as creating any necessary tables or views for reporting.

- Incrementally load data: Use Delta Lake and Delta Live Tables to incrementally load new data into the bronze layer, and automatically propagate the changes through to the silver and gold layers.

- Analyze the data: Use Azure Synapse Analytics or Power BI to build dashboards and reports that visualize and analyze the data in the gold layer.

- Monitor and maintain the platform: Monitor and maintain the platform to ensure it remains secure, reliable, and performant. This includes setting up alerts and monitoring tools, performing regular maintenance and updates, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and best practices.

I hope this helps you get started with implementing a multi-hop architecture for incremental auto load and analysis using Delta Lake and Delta Live Tables in Azure Databricks. Let me know if you have any additional questions or need more guidance on any of these steps.

## Databricks SQL and Python examples for ingesting raw data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 into the "Bronze" data layer and implementing incremental auto loading. Here's an example:

* Ingest raw data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 into the "Bronze" data layer:
You can use Databricks SQL to create an external table in Delta Lake that references the raw data in your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. For example, if your raw data is stored in a CSV file, you can create an external table like this:
```
CREATE TABLE raw_data_csv
USING csv
OPTIONS (
  path "adl://<your-storage-account-name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<your-folder-path>/",
  header "true",
  inferSchema "true",
  delimiter ","
)
```
This creates an external table called raw_data_csv that references the CSV file in your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. You can then use SQL commands to query and transform the data in the raw_data_csv table as needed.

* Implement incremental auto loading:
To implement incremental auto loading, you can use Databricks Delta's MERGE command to update the "Bronze" data layer with new data as it becomes available. Here's an example Python code snippet:
```
from pyspark.sql.functions import *
from delta.tables import *

# Define the paths for the "Bronze" data layer and the source data
bronze_path = "/mnt/<your-delta-lake>/bronze/"
source_path = "adl://<your-storage-account-name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<your-folder-path>/"

# Load the latest file from the source path
latest_file = spark.read.option("inferSchema", "true").csv(source_path).orderBy(desc("_c0")).limit(1)

# Load the current state of the "Bronze" data layer
bronze_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, bronze_path)

# Merge the latest file into the "Bronze" data layer
bronze_table.alias("bronze").merge(
  latest_file.alias("new_data"),
  "bronze.id = new_data.id"
).whenNotMatchedInsertAll().execute()
```

This code loads the latest file from the source path and merges it into the "Bronze" data layer using the MERGE command. The id column is used as the join key to match records in the "Bronze" data layer with the new data. If a record with a matching id is found in the "Bronze" data layer, the record is updated with the new data. If no matching record is found, a new record is inserted.

I hope these examples help you get started with ingesting raw data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 into the "Bronze" data layer and implementing incremental auto loading using Databricks SQL and Python. Let me know if you have any additional questions or need more guidance.

You can use the "MERGE" that is is genius but how about using Spark Structured Streaming such as readStream and writeStream to move the raw data from data source into the "Bronze" then clean up, transform, filter and process into the "Silver" layer.

## You can use Spark Structured Streaming to read data from a data source and write it to the "Bronze" data layer, then transform and write it to the "Silver" data layer. Here's an example Python code snippet that demonstrates how to do this:

```
from pyspark.sql.functions import *
from pyspark.sql.types import *
from delta.tables import *

# Define the schema for the raw data
schema = StructType([
    StructField("col1", StringType(), True),
    StructField("col2", StringType(), True),
    StructField("col3", DoubleType(), True)
])

# Define the path to the raw data in the data source
source_path = "adl://<your-storage-account-name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<your-folder-path>/"

# Define the path to the "Bronze" data layer
bronze_path = "/mnt/<your-delta-lake>/bronze/"

# Define the path to the "Silver" data layer
silver_path = "/mnt/<your-delta-lake>/silver/"

# Read the raw data as a stream
raw_data = spark \
    .readStream \
    .option("header", "true") \
    .schema(schema) \
    .csv(source_path)

# Write the raw data to the "Bronze" data layer as a stream
raw_data \
    .writeStream \
    .format("delta") \
    .option("path", bronze_path) \
    .option("checkpointLocation", "/mnt/<your-checkpoint-location>/bronze/") \
    .start()

# Define the schema for the "Silver" data layer
silver_schema = StructType([
    StructField("col1", StringType(), True),
    StructField("col2", StringType(), True),
    StructField("col3", DoubleType(), True),
    StructField("timestamp", TimestampType(), True)
])

# Define a function to transform and write the data to the "Silver" data layer
def transform_and_write(df, epoch_id):
    transformed_data = df \
        .withColumn("timestamp", current_timestamp()) \
        .filter(col("col3") > 0) \
        .select("col1", "col2", "col3", "timestamp")
    
    silver_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, silver_path)
    silver_table.alias("silver").merge(
        transformed_data.alias("new_data"),
        "silver.col1 = new_data.col1"
    ).whenNotMatchedInsertAll().execute()

# Define a query to transform and write the data to the "Silver" data layer as a stream
silver_query = raw_data \
    .writeStream \
    .foreachBatch(transform_and_write) \
    .option("checkpointLocation", "/mnt/<your-checkpoint-location>/silver/") \
    .start()

# Wait for the query to finish
silver_query.awaitTermination()
```

This code reads the raw data as a stream using the readStream method, and writes it to the "Bronze" data layer using the writeStream method. It then defines a function to transform the data and write it to the "Silver" data layer using Databricks Delta's MERGE command, and uses the foreachBatch method to apply this function to each batch of data as it arrives. Finally, it starts the query and waits for it to finish using the awaitTermination method.

In this example, the raw data is filtered to remove records where col3 is less than or equal to 0, and a timestamp column is added to each record to track when it was processed. The transformed data is then merged into the "Silver" data layer using the **MERGE**

##  Here's an example Python code snippet that demonstrates how to use managed tables and temporary views to aggregate data from the "Silver" layer and some lookup tables into the "Gold" layer:

```
from pyspark.sql.functions import *
from delta.tables import *

# Define the path to the "Silver" data layer
silver_path = "/mnt/<your-delta-lake>/silver/"

# Define the path to the "Gold" data layer
gold_path = "/mnt/<your-delta-lake>/gold/"

# Define the path to the lookup tables
lookup_path = "/mnt/<your-delta-lake>/lookup/"

# Define the schema for the lookup tables
lookup_schema = StructType([
    StructField("id", IntegerType(), True),
    StructField("name", StringType(), True)
])

# Define a function to aggregate the data from the "Silver" layer and the lookup tables and write it to the "Gold" layer
def aggregate_and_write():
    # Read the data from the "Silver" layer as a managed table
    silver_table = spark.table("silver")
    
    # Read the lookup tables as temporary views
    lookup1 = spark.read.format("delta").schema(lookup_schema).load(lookup_path + "table1").createOrReplaceTempView("lookup1")
    lookup2 = spark.read.format("delta").schema(lookup_schema).load(lookup_path + "table2").createOrReplaceTempView("lookup2")
    
    # Perform the aggregation using SQL
    aggregated_data = spark.sql("""
        SELECT l1.name AS name1, l2.name AS name2, COUNT(*) AS count
        FROM silver s
        JOIN lookup1 l1 ON s.col1 = l1.id
        JOIN lookup2 l2 ON s.col2 = l2.id
        GROUP BY l1.name, l2.name
    """)
    
    # Write the aggregated data to the "Gold" layer
    gold_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, gold_path)
    gold_table.alias("gold").merge(
        aggregated_data.alias("new_data"),
        "gold.name1 = new_data.name1 AND gold.name2 = new_data.name2"
    ).whenMatchedUpdateAll().whenNotMatchedInsertAll().execute()

# Define a query to run the aggregation function periodically
gold_query = spark \
    .readStream \
    .format("delta") \
    .option("path", silver_path) \
    .option("latestFirst", "true") \
    .load() \
    .writeStream \
    .trigger(processingTime="5 minutes") \
    .foreachBatch(lambda batch, batch_id: aggregate_and_write()) \
    .start()

# Wait for the query to finish
gold_query.awaitTermination()
```

This code defines a function called **aggregate_and_write** that performs the aggregation using SQL, reads the data from the "Silver" layer as a managed table, and reads the lookup tables as temporary views. It then writes the aggregated data to the "Gold" layer using Databricks Delta's **MERGE** command.

It uses the **spark.readStream** method to read the data from the "Silver" layer as a stream, and the **writeStream** method to periodically apply the **aggregate_and_write** function to each batch of data using the **foreachBatch** method. The **trigger** method is used to control how often the function is applied.

In this example, the **aggregate_and_write** function aggregates the data from the "Silver" layer and two lookup tables (lookup1 and lookup2) using SQL, and writes the aggregated data to the "Gold" layer. The **spark.sql** method is used to execute the SQL.

## To discuss some data engineering techniques for the "Silver" layer using Databricks.

1. Handling Null or Empty Values:
To handle null or empty values in a column, you can use the **fillna()** function to replace null or empty values with a specified value. For example, to replace null values in the column_name column with the string "unknown", you can use the following code:
```
df = df.fillna({'column_name': 'unknown'})
```
2. Changing Data Type for Columns:
To change the data type of a column, you can use the **cast()** function to convert the column to the desired data type. For example, to convert the column_name column from string to double, you can use the following code:
```
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

df = df.withColumn("column_name", col("column_name").cast("double"))
```
3. Cleansing Unnecessary Columns/Rows:
To remove unnecessary columns from a DataFrame, you can use the **drop()** function to drop the columns you don't need. For example, to drop the column_name column from the DataFrame, you can use the following code:
```
df = df.drop("column_name")
```
To remove unnecessary rows from a DataFrame, you can use the **filter()** function to filter the rows you don't need based on a condition. For example, to filter out rows where the column_name column contains the string "unknown", you can use the following code:
```
df = df.filter(df.column_name != "unknown")
```
4. Enriching Date Time:
To convert a Unix timestamp to a human-readable date and time format, you can use the **from_unixtime()** function. For example, to convert the unix_timestamp column to a human-readable date and time format, you can use the following code:
```
from pyspark.sql.functions import from_unixtime

df = df.withColumn("timestamp", from_unixtime("unix_timestamp"))
```
5. sing Databricks Built-in Functions:
Databricks provides several built-in functions that you can use for data analysis. For example, you can use the **input_file_name()** function to get the name of the file that a row of data came from, and you can use the **current_timestamp()** function to get the current timestamp. For example, to add a column to the DataFrame that contains the name of the file that each row came from, you can use the following code:
```
from pyspark.sql.functions import input_file_name

df = df.withColumn("file_name", input_file_name())
```
To add a column to the DataFrame that contains the current timestamp, you can use the following code:
```
from pyspark.sql.functions import current_timestamp

df = df.withColumn("current_time", current_timestamp())
```
hese are just a few examples of the data engineering techniques that you can use in Databricks to clean, transform, and enrich your data in the "Silver" layer.

## To discuss the differences between Delta Lake and Delta Live Tables in Databricks, and their use cases.
Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark and other big data engines. Delta Lake provides several key features, such as:

- Schema enforcement: Delta Lake enforces schema validation and ensures that all data written to a table has the correct schema.

- Time travel: Delta Lake provides built-in version control, allowing you to query data at any point in time.

- Incremental data processing: Delta Lake provides support for efficient incremental data processing, enabling you to process only the new or changed data.

- Data integrity: Delta Lake provides full ACID transactions, ensuring that all data modifications are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.

- Delta Lake is typically used as a data storage layer for batch and streaming workloads, where you need to store and process large volumes of data.

Delta Live Tables is a new feature in Databricks that provides a fully-managed streaming solution for ingesting and processing real-time data. Delta Live Tables provides several key features, such as:

- Easy integration: Delta Live Tables is fully integrated with the Databricks platform, making it easy to set up and use.

- Scalability: Delta Live Tables can handle high-throughput streaming workloads, with support for automatic scaling.

- Real-time processing: Delta Live Tables provides real-time data processing capabilities, enabling you to process data as soon as it arrives.

- Schema evolution: Delta Live Tables supports schema evolution, allowing you to evolve the schema of your data over time.

- Delta Live Tables is typically used for real-time streaming workloads, where you need to process data as soon as it arrives.

In terms of use cases, Delta Lake is a good solution for batch processing workloads, where you need to store and process large volumes of data. Delta Live Tables is a good solution for real-time streaming workloads, where you need to process data as soon as it arrives.

However, in some cases, you may have a combination of batch and streaming workloads. In these cases, you may want to use Delta Lake for storing the data and Delta Live Tables for ingesting and processing the real-time data. For example, you could use Delta Lake to store historical data, and Delta Live Tables to process real-time data as it arrives and merge it with the historical data. This can give you the best of both worlds, allowing you to handle both batch and streaming workloads with ease.
