# Solutions from Chatgbt to implement Lakehouse platform to work on ETL workflows and dashboards reporting.

Here's an overview of the steps you can follow to set up a lakehouse platform using Azure Databricks for batch ETL and dashboard reporting:

- Create an Azure Databricks workspace: To start, you'll need to create an Azure Databricks workspace. You can do this by logging into the Azure portal and selecting "Create a resource", then searching for "Azure Databricks" and following the steps to create a workspace.

- Set up your lakehouse: Next, you'll need to set up your lakehouse in Azure. This involves creating an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account to store your data lake, as well as configuring access controls and setting up data ingestion pipelines using Azure Data Factory or Azure Event Hubs.

- Configure your Azure Databricks cluster: Once you have your lakehouse set up, you'll need to configure your Azure Databricks cluster to process and analyze the data. This involves selecting the appropriate cluster size and configuration options, as well as installing any necessary libraries or packages.

- Create your ETL pipelines: With your cluster set up, you can begin creating your ETL pipelines to transform and load your data into your lakehouse. You can use a variety of tools and techniques for this, such as Apache Spark or SQL-based transformations.

- Build your dashboards: Once your data is loaded into your lakehouse, you can begin building dashboards and reports to visualize and analyze the data. You can use a variety of tools for this, such as Azure Synapse Analytics or Power BI.

- Monitor and maintain your platform: Finally, it's important to monitor and maintain your lakehouse platform to ensure it remains secure, reliable, and performant. This involves setting up alerts and monitoring tools, performing regular maintenance and updates, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and best practices.

I hope this overview helps get you started with building your lakehouse platform on Azure Databricks! Let me know if you have any additional questions or need more guidance on any of these steps.

## Implementing a multi-hop architecture with Delta Lake and Delta Live Tables in Azure Databricks for incremental auto load and analysis. Here are the steps you can follow:

- Set up your Delta Lake: Create a Delta Lake using your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. This will serve as your centralized data repository where you can store and manage your data.

- Define your bronze, silver, and gold layers: Define three layers for your data: bronze, silver, and gold. The bronze layer is the raw, unprocessed data; the silver layer is the cleaned, transformed data; and the gold layer is the final, processed data ready for analysis.

- Load data into the bronze layer: Use Azure Data Factory or Azure Event Hubs to ingest data into the bronze layer. This data should be in its raw, unprocessed form.

- Transform data into the silver layer: Use Delta Lake and Azure Databricks to transform the data in the bronze layer into the silver layer. This includes cleaning, filtering, and aggregating the data as needed.

- Transform data into the gold layer: Use Delta Lake and Azure Databricks to further transform the data in the silver layer into the gold layer. This includes additional processing and analysis, as well as creating any necessary tables or views for reporting.

- Incrementally load data: Use Delta Lake and Delta Live Tables to incrementally load new data into the bronze layer, and automatically propagate the changes through to the silver and gold layers.

- Analyze the data: Use Azure Synapse Analytics or Power BI to build dashboards and reports that visualize and analyze the data in the gold layer.

- Monitor and maintain the platform: Monitor and maintain the platform to ensure it remains secure, reliable, and performant. This includes setting up alerts and monitoring tools, performing regular maintenance and updates, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and best practices.

I hope this helps you get started with implementing a multi-hop architecture for incremental auto load and analysis using Delta Lake and Delta Live Tables in Azure Databricks. Let me know if you have any additional questions or need more guidance on any of these steps.
