# Solutions from Chatgbt to implement Lakehouse platform to work on ETL workflows and dashboards reporting.

Here's an overview of the steps you can follow to set up a lakehouse platform using Azure Databricks for batch ETL and dashboard reporting:

- Create an Azure Databricks workspace: To start, you'll need to create an Azure Databricks workspace. You can do this by logging into the Azure portal and selecting "Create a resource", then searching for "Azure Databricks" and following the steps to create a workspace.

- Set up your lakehouse: Next, you'll need to set up your lakehouse in Azure. This involves creating an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account to store your data lake, as well as configuring access controls and setting up data ingestion pipelines using Azure Data Factory or Azure Event Hubs.

- Configure your Azure Databricks cluster: Once you have your lakehouse set up, you'll need to configure your Azure Databricks cluster to process and analyze the data. This involves selecting the appropriate cluster size and configuration options, as well as installing any necessary libraries or packages.

- Create your ETL pipelines: With your cluster set up, you can begin creating your ETL pipelines to transform and load your data into your lakehouse. You can use a variety of tools and techniques for this, such as Apache Spark or SQL-based transformations.

- Build your dashboards: Once your data is loaded into your lakehouse, you can begin building dashboards and reports to visualize and analyze the data. You can use a variety of tools for this, such as Azure Synapse Analytics or Power BI.

- Monitor and maintain your platform: Finally, it's important to monitor and maintain your lakehouse platform to ensure it remains secure, reliable, and performant. This involves setting up alerts and monitoring tools, performing regular maintenance and updates, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and best practices.

I hope this overview helps get you started with building your lakehouse platform on Azure Databricks! Let me know if you have any additional questions or need more guidance on any of these steps.

## Implementing a multi-hop architecture with Delta Lake and Delta Live Tables in Azure Databricks for incremental auto load and analysis. Here are the steps you can follow:

- Set up your Delta Lake: Create a Delta Lake using your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. This will serve as your centralized data repository where you can store and manage your data.

- Define your bronze, silver, and gold layers: Define three layers for your data: bronze, silver, and gold. The bronze layer is the raw, unprocessed data; the silver layer is the cleaned, transformed data; and the gold layer is the final, processed data ready for analysis.

- Load data into the bronze layer: Use Azure Data Factory or Azure Event Hubs to ingest data into the bronze layer. This data should be in its raw, unprocessed form.

- Transform data into the silver layer: Use Delta Lake and Azure Databricks to transform the data in the bronze layer into the silver layer. This includes cleaning, filtering, and aggregating the data as needed.

- Transform data into the gold layer: Use Delta Lake and Azure Databricks to further transform the data in the silver layer into the gold layer. This includes additional processing and analysis, as well as creating any necessary tables or views for reporting.

- Incrementally load data: Use Delta Lake and Delta Live Tables to incrementally load new data into the bronze layer, and automatically propagate the changes through to the silver and gold layers.

- Analyze the data: Use Azure Synapse Analytics or Power BI to build dashboards and reports that visualize and analyze the data in the gold layer.

- Monitor and maintain the platform: Monitor and maintain the platform to ensure it remains secure, reliable, and performant. This includes setting up alerts and monitoring tools, performing regular maintenance and updates, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and best practices.

I hope this helps you get started with implementing a multi-hop architecture for incremental auto load and analysis using Delta Lake and Delta Live Tables in Azure Databricks. Let me know if you have any additional questions or need more guidance on any of these steps.

## Databricks SQL and Python examples for ingesting raw data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 into the "Bronze" data layer and implementing incremental auto loading. Here's an example:

* Ingest raw data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 into the "Bronze" data layer:
You can use Databricks SQL to create an external table in Delta Lake that references the raw data in your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. For example, if your raw data is stored in a CSV file, you can create an external table like this:
```
CREATE TABLE raw_data_csv
USING csv
OPTIONS (
  path "adl://<your-storage-account-name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<your-folder-path>/",
  header "true",
  inferSchema "true",
  delimiter ","
)
```
This creates an external table called raw_data_csv that references the CSV file in your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. You can then use SQL commands to query and transform the data in the raw_data_csv table as needed.

* Implement incremental auto loading:
To implement incremental auto loading, you can use Databricks Delta's MERGE command to update the "Bronze" data layer with new data as it becomes available. Here's an example Python code snippet:
```
from pyspark.sql.functions import *
from delta.tables import *

# Define the paths for the "Bronze" data layer and the source data
bronze_path = "/mnt/<your-delta-lake>/bronze/"
source_path = "adl://<your-storage-account-name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<your-folder-path>/"

# Load the latest file from the source path
latest_file = spark.read.option("inferSchema", "true").csv(source_path).orderBy(desc("_c0")).limit(1)

# Load the current state of the "Bronze" data layer
bronze_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, bronze_path)

# Merge the latest file into the "Bronze" data layer
bronze_table.alias("bronze").merge(
  latest_file.alias("new_data"),
  "bronze.id = new_data.id"
).whenNotMatchedInsertAll().execute()
```
This code loads the latest file from the source path and merges it into the "Bronze" data layer using the MERGE command. The id column is used as the join key to match records in the "Bronze" data layer with the new data. If a record with a matching id is found in the "Bronze" data layer, the record is updated with the new data. If no matching record is found, a new record is inserted.

I hope these examples help you get started with ingesting raw data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 into the "Bronze" data layer and implementing incremental auto loading using Databricks SQL and Python. Let me know if you have any additional questions or need more guidance.

You can use the "MERGE" that is is genius but how about using Spark Structured Streaming such as readStream and writeStream to move the raw data from data source into the "Bronze" then clean up, transform, filter and process into the "Silver" layer.

##You can use Spark Structured Streaming to read data from a data source and write it to the "Bronze" data layer, then transform and write it to the "Silver" data layer. Here's an example Python code snippet that demonstrates how to do this:
```
python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql.functions import *
from pyspark.sql.types import *
from delta.tables import *

# Define the schema for the raw data
schema = StructType([
    StructField("col1", StringType(), True),
    StructField("col2", StringType(), True),
    StructField("col3", DoubleType(), True)
])

# Define the path to the raw data in the data source
source_path = "adl://<your-storage-account-name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<your-folder-path>/"

# Define the path to the "Bronze" data layer
bronze_path = "/mnt/<your-delta-lake>/bronze/"

# Define the path to the "Silver" data layer
silver_path = "/mnt/<your-delta-lake>/silver/"

# Read the raw data as a stream
raw_data = spark \
    .readStream \
    .option("header", "true") \
    .schema(schema) \
    .csv(source_path)

# Write the raw data to the "Bronze" data layer as a stream
raw_data \
    .writeStream \
    .format("delta") \
    .option("path", bronze_path) \
    .option("checkpointLocation", "/mnt/<your-checkpoint-location>/bronze/") \
    .start()

# Define the schema for the "Silver" data layer
silver_schema = StructType([
    StructField("col1", StringType(), True),
    StructField("col2", StringType(), True),
    StructField("col3", DoubleType(), True),
    StructField("timestamp", TimestampType(), True)
])

# Define a function to transform and write the data to the "Silver" data layer
def transform_and_write(df, epoch_id):
    transformed_data = df \
        .withColumn("timestamp", current_timestamp()) \
        .filter(col("col3") > 0) \
        .select("col1", "col2", "col3", "timestamp")
    
    silver_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, silver_path)
    silver_table.alias("silver").merge(
        transformed_data.alias("new_data"),
        "silver.col1 = new_data.col1"
    ).whenNotMatchedInsertAll().execute()

# Define a query to transform and write the data to the "Silver" data layer as a stream
silver_query = raw_data \
    .writeStream \
    .foreachBatch(transform_and_write) \
    .option("checkpointLocation", "/mnt/<your-checkpoint-location>/silver/") \
    .start()

# Wait for the query to finish
silver_query.awaitTermination()
```
This code reads the raw data as a stream using the readStream method, and writes it to the "Bronze" data layer using the writeStream method. It then defines a function to transform the data and write it to the "Silver" data layer using Databricks Delta's MERGE command, and uses the foreachBatch method to apply this function to each batch of data as it arrives. Finally, it starts the query and waits for it to finish using the awaitTermination method.

In this example, the raw data is filtered to remove records where col3 is less than or equal to 0, and a timestamp column is added to each record to track when it was processed. The transformed data is then merged into the "Silver" data layer using the **MERGE**
