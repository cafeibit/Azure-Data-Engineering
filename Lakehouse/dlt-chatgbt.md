# Solutions from Chatgbt to implement Lakehouse platform to work on ETL workflows and dashboards reporting.

Here's an overview of the steps you can follow to set up a lakehouse platform using Azure Databricks for batch ETL and dashboard reporting:

- Create an Azure Databricks workspace: To start, you'll need to create an Azure Databricks workspace. You can do this by logging into the Azure portal and selecting "Create a resource", then searching for "Azure Databricks" and following the steps to create a workspace.

- Set up your lakehouse: Next, you'll need to set up your lakehouse in Azure. This involves creating an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account to store your data lake, as well as configuring access controls and setting up data ingestion pipelines using Azure Data Factory or Azure Event Hubs.

- Configure your Azure Databricks cluster: Once you have your lakehouse set up, you'll need to configure your Azure Databricks cluster to process and analyze the data. This involves selecting the appropriate cluster size and configuration options, as well as installing any necessary libraries or packages.

- Create your ETL pipelines: With your cluster set up, you can begin creating your ETL pipelines to transform and load your data into your lakehouse. You can use a variety of tools and techniques for this, such as Apache Spark or SQL-based transformations.

- Build your dashboards: Once your data is loaded into your lakehouse, you can begin building dashboards and reports to visualize and analyze the data. You can use a variety of tools for this, such as Azure Synapse Analytics or Power BI.

- Monitor and maintain your platform: Finally, it's important to monitor and maintain your lakehouse platform to ensure it remains secure, reliable, and performant. This involves setting up alerts and monitoring tools, performing regular maintenance and updates, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and best practices.

I hope this overview helps get you started with building your lakehouse platform on Azure Databricks! Let me know if you have any additional questions or need more guidance on any of these steps.
